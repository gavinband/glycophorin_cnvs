This repository contains code and example data relating to the article "Resistance to malaria through structural variation of red blood cell invasion receptors", which can be found here: http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/02/10/083634.
Two pieces of software are available - 

* Scripts used to call large CNVs across the region, together with example data. These can be found in the `call_cnvs` folder.
* A C++ program used to perform a simple exhaustive simulation of possible CNV types, given breakpoints.  This can be found in the `simulate_uc_events` folder.
